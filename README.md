# CarCrashDetector

This project implements a vehicle image classifier using a convolutional neural network (CNN).  
The classifier's goal is to determine whether a vehicle is crashed or not based on an input image.

# Algorithm Description  

The algorithm utilizes a trained convolutional neural network to process vehicle images and perform  
classification. It's a binary classification problem, where the classes are "crashed" and "not crashed."

# Libraries Used  

The project makes use of the following libraries:

*  numpy: for efficient numerical operations.
*  tensorflow: for building and training the convolutional neural network.
*  cv2: for image processing.
*  os: for file and directory manipulation.
*  flask: for creating a web API.
*  matplotlib: for data and results visualization.
*  Project Structure

# The project is organized as follows:

*  Images: Space for storing images used by API users.
*  Model: Contains trained models.
*  Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks where model training and testing are performed.
*  Templates: HTML templates for the API user interface.
*  VENV: Virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
